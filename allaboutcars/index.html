        <p>Friends comment/feedback I'm master electrician, but this site is training me to be a car mechanic. This man has literally saved me thousands of dollars and tons of headaches. Thank you! Good site! Easy to understand and brief!</p>
        <p>As usual this site is on point! You're a master of your trade and seems you still have passion for what you do. You genuinely help people out of the kindness of your heart Learned something new today ! I work at a dealership in parts/service, and I think what you do here is amazing. So many customers could save thousands if they simply followed your step by step guides.</p>
