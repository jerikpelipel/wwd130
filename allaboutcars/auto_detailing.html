                    <h2>1. Gather the necessary supplies</h2>
                    <p class="first_step">Make sure you have all the required supplies before starting. This can include car wash soap, microfiber towels, a soft-bristle brush, a clay bar, wax or sealant, interior cleaner, glass cleaner, and tire shine.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <h2>2. Start with a thorough wash</h2>
                    <p class="second_step">Begin by washing your car using a proper car wash soap and a microfiber wash mitt or sponge. Pay attention to all areas, including the wheels, tires, and undercarriage. Rinse off any soap residue thoroughly.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column">
                    <h2>3. Clay bar treatment</h2>
                    <p class="third_step">To remove embedded contaminants like tar or tree sap, use a clay bar. Spray a lubricant on the surface and gently rub the clay bar in a back-and-forth motion. This helps to smooth the paint and prepare it for polishing or waxing.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="column1">
                    <h2>4. Polish the paint</h2>
                    <p class="fourth_step">If your car's paint has minor scratches or swirl marks, you can use a polishing compound to restore its shine. Apply a small amount of polish to a foam applicator pad or a polishing machine and work it into the paint using circular motions. Wipe off any excess with a microfiber towel.</p>
                    <h2>5. Apply wax or sealant</h2>
                    <p class="fifth_step">Waxing or sealing the paint helps protect it from the elements and gives it a glossy finish. Apply a thin layer of wax or sealant using an applicator pad or a machine. Allow it to dry according to the product's instructions, then buff it off with a clean microfiber towel.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="column1">
                    <h2>6. Clean the interior</h2>
                    <p class="sixth_step">Vacuum the interior thoroughly to remove any dirt or debris. Use an appropriate interior cleaner to clean surfaces like the dashboard, seats, and door panels. Wipe down all surfaces with a microfiber towel, and use a specialized glass cleaner for the windows.</p>
                    <h2>7. Pay attention to details</h2>
                    <p class="seventh_step">Don't forget the smaller details like cleaning the wheels and tires, dressing the tires with a tire shine product, cleaning the exhaust tips, and using a detail brush to clean crevices and hard-to-reach areas. Remember to always follow the instructions and recommendations provided by the manufacturers of the products you use. Take your time, work in sections, and be gentle to avoid damaging the car's paint or interior surfaces.</p>
